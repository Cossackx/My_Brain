## Error-Signature Hardening Pack (2026-02-22 08:46 ET)
- Executed recurring command/read/path hardening pack and published checkpoint bundle: `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/error-signature-hardening-20260222-084646/`.
- Baseline signature inventory captured from today fact stream (`signature-counts-baseline.md`) and tracked in JSON/MD evidence.
- Applied command-safety guardrails to critical cron lanes:
  - `0f2a9abc-6e03-4a4f-8f51-f9c9b14de95a` (War Room Snapshot)
  - `e881f4eb-3288-4792-95f1-5c38e4b484b2` (CUB hourly)
  - `7924d04d-4c46-4851-bbbd-8e1384390e64` (Unit SITREP)
- Seeded missing DreamLab soul files to remove ENOENT-class failures (`dream-soul-seeding.txt`: created 11, existing 28).
- Post-hardening cron payload safety scan result: **VIOLATIONS=0** (`cron-message-safety-scan.md`).
- Gateway service-state policy verification executed (`openclaw status` + doctor checks): gateway reachable; scheduled task remains **Ready/stopped** in monitor-only posture.
- Follow-on closed: N2/CoS re-adjudication published (`System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/n2-hardening-readjudication-2026-02-22.md`) with `QUARANTINE_RELEASE` and monitor-only follow-ups.
- [2026-02-22 08:10:15 America/New_York] OK 2026-02-22 08:10 America/New_York cron-control-plane diagnostic: openclaw cron status --json and openclaw status passed.

- Artifact published: `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/n2-hardening-readjudication-2026-02-22.md`.
- Disposition: **QUARANTINE_RELEASE** (transition from fail-closed to monitor-only watch).
- CoS supervisor validation recorded in artifact (`PASS`, medium confidence).
- Command impact: diagnostics quarantine blocker closed; residual concerns moved to follow-up watch list (signature-delta artifact, cron scan JSON normalization, gateway state policy note).
- Post-publication command-surface gates all PASS (`EXITCODE=0`): `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/n2-hardening-readjudication-gates-20260222-1006/`. 

## 2026-02-22 08:15 ET - 4-axis growth daily check-in
- Updated `System/Reports/RAZSOC/growth/agent-growth-scoreboard.md` with 2026-02-22 ledger scaffold for all 15 active agents (source: `System/Config/razsoc_roles.yaml`).
- Enforcement applied: **no evidence = no credit**; all four axes set to `0 - UNVERIFIED` pending role-level evidence submissions.
- Drift flags recorded: DF-1 triggered (DCOM, CoS, PAO, N3, N35, IG, Safety, Privacy, Records_Manager, CFO); DF-2 triggered for missing weekly review artifacts; DF-3 remains `UNVERIFIED` pending full axis-level data.

## 2026-02-22 09:18 ET - role-evidence completion + drift re-adjudication
- Completed same-day active-role evidence ledger: `System/Reports/RAZSOC/growth/2026-02-22.md` (15/15 active roles with evidence refs).
- Published weekly review artifact: `System/Reports/RAZSOC/growth/2026-W08-weekly-review.md`.
- Updated scoreboard 2026-02-22 cycle from scaffold state to evidence-linked partial scores (`4/8` baseline per active role).
- Re-adjudicated drift flags in scoreboard:
  - `DF-1` -> **CLEARED** (daily submissions evidenced for 2026-02-20/21/22)
  - `DF-2` -> **CLEARED** (weekly artifact present)
  - `DF-3` -> **CLEARED_FOR_CURRENT_CYCLE** (rolling watch remains active)
- Escalation queue moved to **NONE** for current cycle.
- Post-update policy gates verified (`EXITCODE=0` each):
  - `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/growth-drift-clearance-20260222-092514/missionControlContractParity.txt`
  - `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/growth-drift-clearance-20260222-092514/workflowLint.txt`

- [2026-02-22 09:10:15 America/New_York] OK 2026-02-22 09:10 America/New_York cron-control-plane diagnostic: openclaw cron status --json and openclaw status passed.

## Process Drift Remediation (2026-02-22 10:12 ET)
- Root-cause addressed: internal self-approvable blockers were allowed to persist as repeated pending state.
- Corrective controls implemented:
  - CUB hourly cron prompt now enforces same-run closure for internal/reversible/self-approvable blockers.
  - SITREP cron prompt now enforces same-run closure + artifact-exists sync behavior.
  - `System/automation/razsoc/workflowLint.js` now hard-fails if authority-execution contract is missing on critical announce jobs.
- Durable lesson added in `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/lessons.md` to prevent recurrence.
- Verification results: `RAZSOC_WORKFLOW_LINT_OK`, `MISSION_CONTROL_CONTRACT_PARITY_OK`, `RAZSOC_REPORTING_REQUIREMENTS_LINT_OK`.
- Checkpoint artifact: `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/process-drift-remediation-2026-02-22.md`. 
- [2026-02-22 10:29:59 America/New_York] INCIDENT 2026-02-22 10:29 America/New_York cron-control-plane diagnostic: openclaw cron status --json failed (gateway timeout after 30000ms; process exit code 1). Next action: rerun openclaw cron status --json in 1-2 minutes and if it still times out, restart OpenClaw gateway service before retrying.
- [2026-02-22 10:41:26 America/New_York] RECOVERY VERIFIED 2026-02-22 10:29 America/New_York incident: rerun `openclaw cron status --json` succeeded (`exit=0`, `jobs=24`), gateway restart branch not required (`triggered=0`), and runtime health checks (`openclaw gateway health`, `openclaw gateway status`, `openclaw status`) all passed. Evidence: `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/control-plane-timeout-recovery-20260222-104126/`.
- [2026-02-22 10:41:47 America/New_York] WATCH HOLD confirmed: `bash System/automation/razsoc/runDegradationDiagnostics.sh --profile hourly --strict --auto-fix=safe` returned `highest_severity=none` / `strict_reason=strict_gate_clear`. Continue hourly checks with no downgrade.
- [2026-02-22 14:21:46 America/New_York] LIVE-OPTEST ATTEMPT (WhatsApp `/elevated`) BLOCKED: approved execution attempted through inventory + directory + login + send command paths; runtime exposes Telegram only and returned `Unsupported channel: whatsapp` / `Unknown channel: whatsapp` on WhatsApp commands. Evidence: `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/checkpoints/whatsapp-elevated-live-optest-20260222-142117/`.


## Workspace Canonical Path Remediation (2026-02-22 12:50 ET)
- [2026-02-22 12:50:12 America/New_York] EXECUTE path remediation: attached canonical roots into active workspace alias via symlinks (`Ops` -> `../Ops`, `System` -> `../System`, `Tasks` -> `../Tasks`, `TaskNotes` -> `../TaskNotes`).
- [2026-02-22 12:50:27 America/New_York] SOURCE_AVAILABILITY_PASS: canonical sources readable from active workspace (`Ops/RAZSOC/Board/RAZSOC Duty Board.md`, `Ops/RAZSOC/Logs/2026-02-22-runlog.md`, `System/Reports/Codex/approvals/queue.json`, `System/Reports/Codex/tasks/todo.md`).
- [2026-02-22 12:50:35 America/New_York] ADJUDICATION HOLD: maintained while evidence paths were unavailable; released immediately after source-availability pass.
- [2026-02-22 12:51:00 America/New_York] FORCED SITREP RERUN: `RAZSOC Unit SITREPs (every 4h)` (`7924d04d-4c46-4851-bbbd-8e1384390e64`) executed on-demand; output returned GREEN sustainment with canonical evidence restored and queue counts `9/0/0/0`.

- [2026-02-22 15:23:57 America/New_York] RECOVERY BRANCH ATTEMPTED: `openclaw gateway restart` returned health-check failure with token mismatch warning and port conflict (`127.0.0.1:18789` in use by `node.exe` pid `31780`).
- [2026-02-22 15:24:37 America/New_York] DIAGNOSIS: `openclaw doctor` reported gateway service config drift (service command missing gateway subcommand + service token mismatch).
- [2026-02-22 15:25:14 America/New_York] REMEDIATION BLOCKED: `openclaw doctor --fix --force --yes` failed with Windows privilege boundary (`schtasks create failed: ERROR: Access is denied`).
- [2026-02-22 15:25:20 America/New_York] NEXT: run `openclaw doctor --fix --force --yes` from elevated PowerShell (admin) to repair Scheduled Task command/token, then rerun `openclaw cron status --json` and append recovery evidence same-cycle.
- [2026-02-22 12:10:15 America/New_York] OK 2026-02-22 12:10 America/New_York cron-control-plane diagnostic: openclaw cron status --json and openclaw status passed.
